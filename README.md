# CodeAlpha_FileConverter
File conversion is the process of converting data from one file format to another. This is useful when you need to convert a Word document to a PDF file or vice versa. File formats are standardized ways in which information is encoded for storage in a file, and software programs are designed to read specific file formats.
There are many free tools available in online that allows you to convert one file type to multiple formats. However finding the right one is difficult especially when you want to convert a sinlge file to multiple formats at a time. This project is made specifically to deal with this drawback. Compared to general conversion, here the conversion process is quite different, you need to paste your text into the textarea and then select conversion type. The reason for pasting into text area is to avoid problem of file corruption where some times conversion is not possible.
This project converts the given text into various formats including:
1. Text (.txt)
2. PDF (.pdf)
3. HTML (.html)
4. Java Script (.js)
5. Document (.doc)
6. Presentation (.ppt)
